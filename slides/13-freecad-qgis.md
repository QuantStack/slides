# Why Should FreeCAD/QGIS Users Care?
---

## Moving beyond traditional tools

- Use JupyterCAD instead of FreeCAD when:
  - You want parametric modeling **in notebooks**
  - You need real-time team input
  - You donâ€™t want to install anything  

- Use JupyterGIS instead of ArcGIS/QGIS when:
  - You need to **integrate GIS with Python code**
  - You want to share workflows as reproducible notebooks
  - You care about client-side performance and transparency
